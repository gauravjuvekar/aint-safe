/** \file double_buffer.h
 *
 * Nested multiple-producer multiple-consumer double buffer to store the most
 * recent value with static storage.
 *
 * Usage:
 * \code{.c}
 * typedef struct {...} MyStruct;
 *
 * // Must be initialized to some sane value as this can be returned to a
 * // reader initially.
 * static MyStruct array[2];
 *
 * DoubleBuffer global_latest_value = DOUBLE_BUFFER_STATIC_INIT(
 *         sizeof(MyStruct), array);
 *
 * void handler_writer(void) {
 *     // some interrupt, eg systick, or value from some sensor
 *     MyStruct *latest = DoubleBuffer_write_acquire(&global_latest_value);
 *     if (latest != NULL) {
 *         // write value into *latest
 *     }
 *     DoubleBuffer_write_commit(&global_latest_value, latest);
 * }
 *
 * void handler2(void) {
 *     // periodically check the latest value
 *     MyStruct *latest = DoubleBuffer_read_acquire(&global_latest_value);
 *     ... // Do something with *latest
 *     DoubleBuffer_read_release(&global_latest_value, latest);
 * }
 *
 * void handler_n(void) {
 *     // Can be just like handler2
 *     handler2();
 * }
 *
 * // handler_writer, handler2, ... handler_n can have any priorities. Any of
 * // them can interrupt any other handler.
 * \endcode
 *
 * \note acquire() and commit()/release() must happen in a nested order. The
 * best way to ensure this is that each function calls acqurire() only once and
 * calls the corresponding commit()/release() before it returns.
